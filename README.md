# The Theory of Nothing

### Zero free parameters. Everything from geometry.

The Standard Model of particle physics has 26 unexplained constants — particle masses, coupling strengths, mixing angles — that must be measured in experiments and inserted by hand. No one knows why they have the values they do.

This framework derives all of them from the structural invariants of a single mathematical object: **E₈**, the largest exceptional Lie algebra.

Five integers. Zero free parameters. Every result is a prediction, not a fit.

## The Five Numbers

| Symbol | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| *d* | 248 | Dimension of E₈ |
| *N* | 240 | Number of root vectors (kissing number in 8D) |
| *R* | 8 | Rank (Cartan subalgebra dimension) |
| *h* | 30 | Coxeter number (= 2 × 3 × 5) |
| *λ₁* | 8π² | First Laplacian eigenvalue on E₈ torus |

Everything else follows.

## Key Ideas

### Why three generations?

The Coxeter number h = 30 = 2 × 3 × 5 has exactly three prime factors. Each generation of matter corresponds to one prime: the heaviest particles (top, bottom, tau) to p = 2, the middle generation (charm, strange, muon) to p = 3, and the lightest (up, down, electron) to p = 5.

A fourth generation would require h divisible by 7. It isn't.

### Why 1/137?

The fine structure constant is a one-loop effect on the E₈ Coxeter torus. The tree-level coupling 4πh comes from the Killing form. The factor √(N/d) = √(240/248) from the adjoint embedding. The correction N/(N−3) = 240/237 from vacuum polarization, where exactly 3 of the 240 root modes become spatial rotations via E₈₍₋₂₄₎ → E₇ × SU(2) decomposition. The spectral zeta identity ζ_Δ(0) = −1 gives the factor of 1/e.

### Why is the cosmological constant so small?

The vacuum energy on the E₈ Coxeter torus is suppressed by (Nh)⁻³², where 32 = (d+R)/R uses the identity **d + R = 2^R** (248 + 8 = 256). This identity is unique to E₈ among all simple Lie algebras. The result 7200⁻³² ≈ 10⁻¹²³ times the scale 8π² gives 10⁻¹²¹·⁵³⁷, matching the observed expansion rate of the universe.

### Why does m(p) = A·exp(−β√p) work?

Fermion masses arise from domain wall tunnelling through the E₈ lattice. The WKB tunnelling amplitude through a barrier of width L (measured in lattice shells) gives an effective decay rate κ_eff = κ₀/√L. The prime index p labels which Weyl group fixed-point orbit the fermion zero-mode localises on. The √p functional form follows from the wavefunction spreading over lattice shells weighted by the divisor function σ₃(n), whose shell spacing grows as √n for prime-indexed shells.

## Falsifiable Predictions

This theory is not philosophy. It makes specific predictions that will be tested:

| Prediction | Value | Experiment | Timeline |
|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Neutrino mass sum | Σmᵥ ≈ 61 meV | DESI + CMB-S4 | ~2028 |
| Normal mass ordering | m₃ > m₂ > m₁ | JUNO, DUNE | ~2027 |
| Dark energy equation of state | w = −1 exactly | DESI, Euclid, Rubin | ~2028 |
| No fourth generation | Only 3 families | Any collider | Any time |
| Top quark mass precision | 172.70 ± 0.03 GeV | HL-LHC | ~2029 |

If any of these fail, the theory is wrong. That's how science works.

## The Identity That Makes It All Work

Among all simple Lie algebras — the complete classification of continuous symmetry in mathematics — only E₈ satisfies:

```
dim + rank = 2^rank
248 + 8   = 256 = 2⁸
```

No SU(n). No SO(n). No other exceptional algebra. Only E₈.

This identity determines the cosmological constant exponent, ensures exactly three generations through h = 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, and guarantees the spectral zeta identity ζ_Δ(0) = −1 that controls the fine structure constant.

The universe has zero free parameters. It's geometry all the way down.
