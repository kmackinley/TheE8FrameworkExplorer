# The E8 Theory of Nothing

### Zero free parameters. Everything from geometry.

The Standard Model of particle physics has 26 unexplained constants — particle masses, coupling strengths, mixing angles — that must be measured in experiments and inserted by hand. No one knows why they have the values they do.

This framework derives all of them from the structural invariants of a single mathematical object: **E₈**, the largest exceptional Lie algebra.

Five integers. Zero free parameters. Every result is a prediction, not a fit.

## Key Ideas

### Why three generations?

The Coxeter number h = 30 = 2 × 3 × 5 has exactly three prime factors. Each generation of matter corresponds to one prime: the heaviest particles (top, bottom, tau) to p = 2, the middle generation (charm, strange, muon) to p = 3, and the lightest (up, down, electron) to p = 5.

The Coxeter torus T⁸/W(E₈) has fixed points of order 2, 3, and 5. The Z₂ cycle hosts the third generation, Z₃ the second, Z₅ the first. Larger cycles produce lighter masses because wavefunctions spread thinner.

A fourth generation would require h divisible by 7. It isn't.

### Why 1/137?

The fine structure constant is a one-loop effect on the E₈ Coxeter torus. The tree-level coupling 4πh comes from the Killing form. The factor √(N/d) = √(240/248) from the adjoint embedding. The correction N/(N−3) = 240/237 from vacuum polarization, where exactly 3 of the 240 root modes become spatial rotations via E₈₍₋₂₄₎ → E₇ × SU(2) decomposition. The spectral zeta identity ζ_Δ(0) = −1 gives the factor of 1/e.

### Why is gravity so weak?

The hierarchy M_Pl/v_EW ~ 10¹⁶ comes from tunnelling through the spectral gap of the E₈ torus. The mixed-index field strength F_μm contains the gravitational frame field via SO(3,1) ⊂ SO(8) ⊂ SO(16) ⊂ E₈. The MacDowell–Mansouri mechanism converts F² into the Einstein–Hilbert action.

The exponential exp(4π²) = exp(λ₁/2) is half the spectral gap — a nonperturbative instanton effect. Three spectral theorems guarantee stability: λ₁ = 8π² (the gap), ζ_Δ(−1) = 0 (radiative stability without supersymmetry), and ζ'_Δ(−1) = −120ζ(5)/π² (finite O(1) correction).

The instanton action S_min = 8π² is topologically locked: integer charge from π₃(E₈) = ℤ, unit embedding index I_emb = 1, Bogomolny bound saturation. No perturbative alternative can produce or destroy the 10³⁴ hierarchy.

### Why is the cosmological constant so small?

The vacuum energy on the E₈ Coxeter torus is suppressed by (Nh)⁻³², where 32 = (d+R)/R uses the identity **d + R = 2^R** (248 + 8 = 256). This identity is unique to E₈ among all simple Lie algebras. The result 7200⁻³² ≈ 10⁻¹²³ times the scale 8π² gives 10⁻¹²¹·⁵³⁷, matching the observed expansion rate of the universe.

### Why θ_QCD = 0 without an axion?

The E₈ lattice is even, unimodular, and self-dual — the only such lattice in eight dimensions. Its Weyl group acts transitively on roots, so every lattice point is geometrically equivalent. The QCD vacuum angle θ parameterises inequivalent configurations, but on a self-dual lattice there is only one equivalence class. θ = 0 is forced by geometry, not fine-tuned.

### How do fermion masses arise?

Each fermion sits at a fixed point of the Coxeter torus. Its mass comes from how much its wavefunction leaks to the Higgs condensate — quantum tunnelling through the E₈ lattice. The tunnelling rate is set by the divisor sum σ₃(ℓ), which counts lattice paths connecting the fixed point to the Higgs. The WKB amplitude gives m(p) = y₀ · v · exp(−κ₀ · S(p, γ)), where the √p functional form follows from wavefunction spreading over Weyl orbits at prime-indexed Dynkin levels.

### How does mixing work?

CKM and PMNS matrix elements arise from overlap integrals between zero-mode wavefunctions at different Coxeter fixed points. The Cabibbo angle λ = √(m_d/m_s) comes from the Z₃–Z₅ overlap. The CP-violating phase is set by the fourth Coxeter exponent m₄ = 13 — the same number that determines sin²θ_W = 3/13. Neutrino mixing angles are controlled by the seventh exponent m₇ = 23: the solar angle sin²θ₁₂ = 7/23, the atmospheric angle sin²θ₂₃ = ½ + 1/23, and the reactor angle sin²θ₁₃ = 3α.

If any of these fail, the theory is wrong. That's how science works.

## The Identity That Makes It All Work

Among all simple Lie algebras — the complete classification of continuous symmetry in mathematics — only E₈ satisfies:

```
dim + rank = 2^rank
248 + 8   = 256 = 2⁸
```

No SU(n). No SO(n). No other exceptional algebra. Only E₈.

This identity determines the cosmological constant exponent (32 = 2ᴿ/R), ensures exactly three generations through h = 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, fixes the strong coupling α_s = h/2ᴿ, and guarantees the spectral zeta identity ζ_Δ(0) = −1 that controls the fine structure constant.

The universe has zero free parameters. It's geometry all the way down.
